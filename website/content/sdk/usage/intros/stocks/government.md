description: This guide introduces the Government submenu, within the Stocks menu, by briefly explaining the features and how to use them, showing examples in context.
---

The Government module provides programmatic access to the same functions from the [OpenBB Terminal](https://docs.openbb.co/terminal/usage/intros/stocks/gov). They provide an excellent supplement to fundamental and macroeconomic research. Please note that this module will only return data from the USA.

## How to Use

Below is a list of all the commands and a brief description. There are two types of function: ticker-specific, and non-specific. Many of these tables also have a companion `_chart` function.

|Path |Type| Description |
|:----------------|:------:|----------------------------:|
|openbb.stocks.gov.contracts|Ticker |Contracts Awarded to a Company |
|openbb.stocks.gov.gtrades |Ticker |Reported Trades in a Company's Stock by Members of the US Congress and Senate |
|openbb.stocks.gov.histcont|Ticker |The Quarterly Total Amount Paid to a Company by the Government |
|openbb.stocks.gov.lastcontracts |All |The Latest Invoices Paid by the US Treasury Department |
|openbb.stocks.gov.lasttrades| All|The Latest Reported Trades Made by Members of the US Congress and Senate |
|openbb.stocks.gov.lobbying|Ticker | Recorded Lobbying Efforts by a Company |
|openbb.stocks.gov.qtrcontracts|All |Ranking Companies by Total Amount Rewarded |
|openbb.stocks.gov.topbuys|All |The Top Buyers in Office |
|openbb.stocks.gov.toplobbying|All |Corporate Lobbyist Activity and the Specific Issues |
|openbb.stocks.gov.topsells|All |The Top Sellers in Office |

Alternatively, Python's built-in help will display the contents of the module, or specific function.

```python
help(openbb.stocks.gov)
```
