## Customizing your Bot Experience

OpenBB offers many different customization options for your bot experience. We have two different accounts you can have and it all start by registering at the [OpenBB HUB](https://my.openbb.co)

Once you are registered the next step is linking your account. You can find this under "Linked Platforms" on the Hub Page - an explanation of how to link is provided there.
