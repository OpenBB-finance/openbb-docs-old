To understand whether you are using an Apple Sillicon (M1) device or an Intel-based device click on the Apple Icon at the top left of your MacBook and select "About This Mac". Then under "Chip" if it says something like "Apple M1 Pro" or "Apple M1 Max", you know you have an Apple Silicon MacBook. If it says for example "2,3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7" you know that you have an Intel-based MacBook and you can continue by clicking on the "Mac Intel Installer" button.
