## Installation and Updates

<details><summary>How much hard drive space is required?</summary>

An installation will use approximately 4-5 GB of space, with additional storage required for optional machine learning models.

</details>

<details><summary>What is the minimum version of Windows or MacOS required to install the OpenBB Terminal?</summary>

The OpenBB Terminal installation packages are compatible with:

- Windows 10 or later.
- MacOS Monterey or later.

**Note:** Machines which are not compatible with the installer packages may be able to install from the source code.

</details>

<details><summary>How do I update my installation to the latest version?</summary>

The terminal is constantly being updated with new features and bug fixes. The process for updating will vary by the installation type:

- As of version 2.4.1, the Windows installer has an option for uninstalling the existing prior to updating.
- For other installer versions, uninstall the previous version (uninstall.exe for Windows, delete the Application folder on MacOS); then, download the latest version and reinstall. User settings and data will remain.
- For a `pip` installation, when a new version is published: `pip install -U openbb[all]`
- Upgrade a cloned version of the GitHub repo with:

```console
git fetch
git pull
poetry install -E all
```

**Notes:** If the cloned repository is a fork, pull from: `git pull origin main` or `git pull origin develop`. If there are changes locally to the files that conflict with the incoming changes from GitHub, stash them before pulling from main with `git stash`.
