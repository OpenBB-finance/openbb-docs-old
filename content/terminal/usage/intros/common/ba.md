The Behavioural Analysis menu offers the user tools for gauging the overall public sentiment of a company online. The complexity of the tools range from message board scrapers to deep learning algorithms for financial analysis and prediction. Sentiment is particularly useful for momentum trading strategies, discovery, and general fundamental research. Navigate into the menu from the <a href="/terminal/usage/intros/stocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stocks</a> menu by entering, `ba`; or, using absolute paths from anywhere in the Terminal: `/stocks/ba`

### How to use

Some data sources will require a valid API key, which can be obtained for free and then set using the [Keys menu](https://docs.openbb.co/terminal/quickstart/api-keys). As with every command, using the `-h` argument displays the help dialogue. Running the <a href="/terminal/reference/stocks/ba/headlines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a> command returns the following:

```
(🦋) /stocks/ba/ $ headlines
```

Alternatively, running the <a href="/terminal/reference/stocks/ba/snews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snews</a> command returns the following:

```
(🦋) /stocks/ba/ $ snews
```

The Reddit functions will return popular tickers and posts, or measure sentiment for a particular stock. An example would be by looking at the threads that pop up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/r/wallstreetbets</a>, famous for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/wallstreetbets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop short squeeze</a>:
