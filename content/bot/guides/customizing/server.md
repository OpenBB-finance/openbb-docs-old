## Customizing your Server Bot Experience

The Server plan for OpenBB Bot offers three different capabilities - Charting, BillBoard, and Auto Posting. Any server that registers with us on the [OpenBB HUB](https://my.openbb.co) gets access to set up one Auto Posting for free. Once you have paid plan you have full access to all these features.

## Server

### Auto Posting (Discord Only)

Auto Posting is our most powerful feature for Discord Servers - We offer the ability to push updates into the server for Flow, Darkpool, or Heatmap/Charts. (more to come soon!) Once you set up your account you will be able to query the bot directly in your server like below :

Or you can manage them at the HUB :

We currently offer the following Auto Posting Categories:

| Category | Description |  Choices |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| Flow  | Options Flow for all stocks | Opening, Golden Sweep, Large, Unusual, Weekly, Above Ask/Below Bid |
| Darkpool  | Darkpool Data for the market | Large |
| Heatmap  | Overview of the market | S&P 500, Dow Jones 30, NASDAQ 100, Russell 1000, Russell 2000, Crypto, Heatchart |


### Charting

Custom charting works the same way as Individual charting but it will apply to your full server. If you want everyone in your server to use the "Classic" theme and have RSI + 50d SMA then it will display that way for all users in your server (unless they have already registered their own individual account).

### BillBoard

BillBoard is a way to advertise to your users when they run a command on the bot. Within your server you can set your own text to display on applicable commands as they are run.
