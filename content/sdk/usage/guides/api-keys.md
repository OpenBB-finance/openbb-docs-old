## The Keys Module

API (Application Programming Interface) keys are access credentials for obtaining data from a particular source. They are a string of random characters assigned, by the data provider, to an individual account. Most vendors offer a free tier requiring only a valid email address, some will require an account with proper KYC (Know Your Customer). Each source is entered into the SDK with the `openbb.keys` module, using the syntax described in the sections below. Wrapping the command with `help()` will print the docstrings to the screen. For example:

```console
help(openbb.keys.reddit)
```

Which prints:

```console
    Set Reddit key
  
    Parameters
    ----------
    client_id: str
        Client ID
    client_secret: str
        Client secret
    password: str
        User password
    username: str
        User username
    useragent: str
        User useragent
    persist: bool, optional
        If False, api key change will be contained to where it was changed. For example, a Jupyter notebook session.
        If True, api key change will be global, i.e. it will affect terminal environment variables.
        By default, False.
    show_output: bool, optional

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Status of key set
  
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from openbb_terminal.sdk import openbb
    >>> openbb.keys.reddit(
            client_id="example_id",
            client_secret="example_secret",
            password="example_password",
            username="example_username",
            useragent="example_useragent"
        )
```

A message similar to the one below will be printed when a function requesting data from an API is called but the key has not yet been entered.

```console
openbb.stocks.quote("AAPL")
API_KEY_FINANCIALMODELINGPREP not defined. Set API Keys in ~/.openbb_terminal/.env or under keys menu.
```

The menu also provides a method for testing the validity of a key upon entry. It can be easy to copy & paste the string with a missing character; so, if the test fails, check that the values were correctly recorded with the command:

```console
openbb.keys.mykeys(show = True)
```

**We recommend gradually obtaining keys, when the use of a specific function requires it.**

## Instructions by Source

This section covers all API keys listed above and include detailed instructions how to obtain each API key. By clicking on each name, the section will expand and instructions are provided. Include, `persist = True` in the syntax to permanently store the key on the machine.
